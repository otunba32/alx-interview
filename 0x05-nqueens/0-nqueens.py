    Description: The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking 
                 queens on an NxN chessboard. Write a program tha solve the N
                 queens problem.

    Usage: nqueen4s N:
            If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments,
            print usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exist with the
            status 1
    Where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4:
            If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new
            line, and exist with the status 1
            If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by new 
            line, and exit with the status 1
    The programe should print every possible solution to the problem:
            One solution per line
            Format: see example
            you don't have to print the solution in a specific order
    You are only allowed to import the sys module
